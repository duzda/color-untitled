This is my first project created with Godot engine. The game lacks a lot in many aspects, for the reasons described below and my lack of knowledge. Feel free to have fun though!

The theme of this project is Color, which was picked based on last few game jams. To make things a little bit more interesting I decided to go with no assets challenge, which ended up being very limiting, as I had to either use engine builtins or shaders.

For the best experience it's recommended to have third-party cookies allowed.
